# More Brass - a 7 Days 2 Die Modlet

Most ingredients (lead, nitrate, and coal) for the manufacturing of bullets are easily gathered from mining nodes and an auger. If you are struggling to find enough brass to keep up with your bullet making demands then this is the modlet for you.

This modlet will greatly increase the amount of brass you are receiving when brass resources such as door knobs, radiators, etc. are smelted down in the forge.

The game (client and server) will load the mods in ascending order. Conflicts in settings will be handled by the last setting read being kept.  I recommend purposefully assigning the load order by prefixing the mod folders with a two-digit number. For example:

```
/Mods/01 Real_Food_Water_Bars
/Mods/02 GoodlysGoodies
/Mods/04 Oignon Vehicles Pack
/Mods/05 BdubsVehicles
/Mods/50 War3zuk Alpha 18 AIO
/Mods/99 More Brass
```

This will ensure that the brass weights set in More Brass override those set in prior mods.
